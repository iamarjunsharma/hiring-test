## Welcome to the ReactJS Hiring Exercise

Awesome!  Are you excited?  Pumped up?  Ready to go?  Great!

### What is this?

We want to be sure that we're on the same page as far as your ability and our expectations of you, and so have this exercise that we use for a few reasons:

- To get a sense for how you write code
- To get a sense for how you test code
- To get a sense for how we can communicate with you about your code

So we put together this exercise that usually takes on the order of 60-90 minutes to do.  Don't overthink it.

### Requirements

- You should start a new project using create-react-app or similar
- Immediately mark an initial commit - this will serve as a starting point
- On completion, create a commit called "code-complete"
- Feel free to do refactoring/design improvements after that point in further commits
- This project will be `git clone`d by us, then `npm install && npm start`.  If it needs more configuration than that, then it's probably not a great sign
- The application state should be stored in Redux
- The components should be tested

#### The application will have two components

1. A list of accounts that the user can add to.  Each account has a single property - a balance
1. A repayment model (not displayed explicitly) that will take the overall balance of the accounts, a monthly payment amount and return a time series of the balance as monthly payments are applied
1. A "working model" area of the app that the user can put in a monthly payment amount, and a repayment model below will update/redraw itself

### Submitting

- Push this repository to github
- Email arjun.sharma17@gmail.com with the location of the repository - if you would like it to be private, then add the github user `iamarjunsharma` as a collaborator
- We will review the code within 24 hours and we can discuss it in github

### Criteria

- Clarity
- Adherence to "standards"
- Testing methodology/coverage
- "Does it work"
- Time to complete
- Attached is a screenshot of the version of this exercise that we built.  This is an intentionally graphically bare version of the project to communicate the main components.
